        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Specialty Barista Training IO . We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice, or our practices with regards to your personal information, </p>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to all information collected through our website (such as specialtybaristatraining.io), and/or any related services, sales, marketing or events (we refer to them collectively in this privacy notice as the "Services").</p>

            <li>For internal analytics and reporting to improve our Services.</li>
